# YOLO-Cam-Based-Object-detection-
Welcome to the repository for our project focused on real-time object detection in CCTV recorded footage using the YOLOv8 model.
This project aims to provide an efficient and accurate solution for identifying objects within video streams,
annotating frames with bounding boxes, class labels, and detection accuracy, while also offering insightful data analysis.
