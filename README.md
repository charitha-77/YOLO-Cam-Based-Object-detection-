# YOLO-Cam-Based-Object-detection-
Welcome to the repository for our project focused on real-time object detection in CCTV recorded footage using the YOLOv8 model.
This project aims to provide an efficient and accurate solution for identifying objects within video streams,
annotating frames with bounding boxes, class labels, and detection accuracy, while also offering insightful data analysis.
This repository contains all my work in progress of project in implementing YOLO Cam based on object detection implemented with machine learning.
And also the colab notebooks uploaded may contain extra unwanted libraries and few cells due to multiple approaches tried by me,
during my progress, so ignore if they are not removed by any chance.
